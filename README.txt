README

Hello there!

Before you get started using this code you will obviously need a Spotify account. Spotipy, a python wrapper for the web API and MathLabPlot both need to be installed (PIP is easiest).

Along with that a Spotify Developer account will be needed to actually have permission to access data. The secret and client ID can be pasted into the appropriate spots in the code.

Included in the repository is a screenshot of what the output can be expected to look like.

This project demonstrates how APIâ€™s can be used to present some interesting data quickly and efficiently (I also just find it fun to analyze music preferences).


*Helpful Tip*

If you connect your Spotify account to Facebook your username is actually a randomly generated sequence of numbers (I know crazy right!) to find it I would recommend looking under your profile settings.
